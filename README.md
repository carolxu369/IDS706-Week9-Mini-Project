# IDS706-Week9-Mini-Project: Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation

This README provides an overview of the data manipulation and analysis tasks performed on the Iris dataset in the Jupyter Notebook `data.ipynb` located in this repository. The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, featuring measurements of iris flowers, including details on petal and sepal sizes, along with the species classification.

## Notebook Overview

The Jupyter Notebook consists of the following sections, detailing the data manipulation and analysis process:

### 1. **Data Loading**
   - The Iris dataset is loaded directly using Seaborn.
   - Initial exploration of the dataset, such as viewing the first few rows and checking the dataset size and shape.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Inspection for missing values or inconsistencies in the dataset.

### 3. **Data Transformation**
   - Standardize the feature columns (sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width) so they're on the same scale.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
   - Different Data Visualization:
     - Species count plot to understand the distribution of different species.
